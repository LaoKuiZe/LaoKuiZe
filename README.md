## 👋 Hi, I'm Yuyang Zhao

I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science, currently exploring the intersection of  
**Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **AI Agents**.

🤖 I'm especially interested in multimodal agents that interact with real-world environments,  
and I am currently working on OS-level agents.

📚 Recently, I've been working on multimodal LLM-based agent systems,  
and I'm interested in further exploring model training and reinforcement learning.

🏸 Outside of research and coding, I enjoy playing badminton, watching tech talks,  
and experimenting with new tools and frameworks.

🌱 Actively seeking research opportunities and collaborations.
