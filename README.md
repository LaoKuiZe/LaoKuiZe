## 👋 Hi, I'm Yuyang Zhao

I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science from USTC, currently exploring the intersection of  
**AI Agents**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and**Reinforcement Learning**.

🤖 I'm interested in multimodal agents that interact with real-world environments. Recently, I have been focusing on GUI agents as a practical step toward this goal.

📚 My research explores model training and reinforcement learning to support embodied agents with grounded perception and action.

🏸 Outside of research and coding, I enjoy playing badminton, watching tech talks,  
and experimenting with new tools and frameworks.

🌱 Actively seeking research opportunities and collaborations.
