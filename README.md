## 👋 Hi, I'm Yuyang Zhao

I'm an undergraduate student in Computer Science from USTC, currently exploring the intersection of  
**Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **AI Agents**.

🤖 I'm interested in multimodal agents that interact with real-world environments.  
Recently, I've been exploring OS-level agents as part of this direction.

📚 At the moment, I'm actively learning more about model training and reinforcement learning,  
and hoping to build a stronger foundation through hands-on research.

🏸 Outside of research and coding, I enjoy playing badminton, watching tech talks,  
and experimenting with new tools and frameworks.

🌱 Actively seeking research opportunities and collaborations.
